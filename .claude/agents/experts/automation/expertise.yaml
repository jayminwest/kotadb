    curator_ts:
      path: automation/src/curator.ts
      purpose: Haiku-powered context curator for inter-phase handoffs

    auto_record_ts:
      path: automation/src/auto-record.ts
      purpose: Automated workflow outcome recording

    pr_ts:
      path: automation/src/pr.ts
      purpose: PR creation with validation, git status parsing, and GitHub integration

    migration_005:
      path: app/src/db/migrations/005_workflow_contexts.sql
      purpose: Schema for workflow context storage

key_operations:
  suppress_sdk_stderr:
    when: Providing custom console output without SDK default dots
    approach: Configure SDK options with stderr callback that captures or ignores stderr
    code_example: See examples/suppress-stderr.ts
      
  integrate_sdk_hooks:
    when: Adding action-level logging for tool execution
    approach: Use SDK hooks (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Notification) to intercept tool calls
    code_example: See examples/sdk-hooks.ts
      
  implement_console_reporter:
    when: Creating user-facing real-time workflow progress output
    approach: Build ConsoleReporter class with ANSI formatting, verbosity-aware logging, phase timing
    code_example: See examples/console-reporter.ts
      
  integrate_sdk_query:
    when: Setting up Claude Agent SDK workflow execution
    approach: Import query() from SDK and configure with appropriate options
    code_example: See examples/sdk-query.ts
      
  configure_mcp_server:
    when: Enabling kotadb MCP tools in SDK workflow
    approach: Configure mcpServers object with stdio transport, --stdio flag, and KOTADB_PATH env var
    code_example: |
      mcpServers: {
        kotadb: {
          type: "stdio",
          command: "bunx",
          args: ["--bun", "kotadb", "--stdio"],  // MUST include --stdio flag
          env: { KOTADB_PATH: join(mainProjectRoot, ".kotadb", "kota.db") }  // NOT KOTADB_CWD
        }
      }
    pitfalls:
      - Missing --stdio flag causes MCP connection failures
      - Using KOTADB_CWD instead of KOTADB_PATH (deprecated pattern)
      - Not providing absolute path to kota.db in worktree contexts
      - Pointing to worktree DB instead of main repo DB

  validate_anthropic_model_names:
    when: Configuring SDK queries with specific model versions
    approach: Validate Anthropic model names follow claude-{variant}-{major}-{minor}-{date} format
    examples:
      - claude-opus-4-1-20250514
      - claude-haiku-4-5-20251001
      - claude-sonnet-4-20250514

  configure_mcp_toolset:
    when: Selecting MCP tool tier for workflow requirements
    approach: Configure mcpServers with --toolset flag to control available tools
    tiers:
      core: 6 tools (minimal)
      default: 8 tools (standard)
      memory: 14 tools (with memory)
      full: 19 tools (all capabilities)
    code_example: See examples/mcp-toolset.ts
      
  implement_context_accumulation:
    when: Enabling inter-phase data handoff for multi-phase workflows
    approach: Store curated context at end of each phase in main KotaDB database
    code_example: See examples/context-accumulation.ts

  curate_context_between_phases:
    when: Need to inject relevant memory context between workflow phases
    approach: Use lightweight haiku curator to query KotaDB memory tools and produce ~500 token curated summary
    code_example: See examples/curator.ts
  
  auto_record_workflow_outcomes:
    when: Workflow completes (success or failure)
    approach: Automatically record outcomes using haiku (success -> record_decision, failure -> record_failure)
    code_example: See examples/auto-record.ts

  parse_git_status:
    when: Extracting filenames from git status --porcelain output
    approach: Use regex to handle all status codes robustly
    code_example: |
      const match = line.match(/^..\s+(.+)$/);
      const filename = match?.[1]?.trim() ?? line.trim();
    pitfalls:
      - Using substring(3) breaks with single-char status codes or varying spacing
      - Not handling edge cases (renamed files, merge conflicts)
      - Assuming consistent spacing between status and filename

  create_pr_with_validation:
    when: Creating PR after automated workflow completion
    approach: Run validation commands (typecheck, test), build structured PR body with evidence
    structure: |
      ## Summary
      [Automated implementation details]
      
      ## Validation Evidence
      ### Validation Level: 1|2|3
      **Justification**: [Level rationale]
      **Commands Run**:
      - ✅/❌ `command` - output
      
      ## Anti-Mock Compliance
      [Anti-mock statement]
      
      ## Plan
      [Plan reference]
      
      ## Metrics (if available)
      [Token/cost table]
      
      Closes #N
      ADW ID: workflow-id
    pitfalls:
      - Not running validation before PR creation
      - Missing anti-mock statement
      - Wrong PR title format (should match /git:pull_request)
      - Not removing redundant prefixes from issue titles

decision_trees:
  console_output_strategy:
    question: How should I output console feedback for this event?
    branches:
      - condition: File creation/modification
        action: reporter.logKeyAction() - always shown
      - condition: Tool execution details
        action: reporter.logToolUse()/logToolComplete() - verbose only
      - condition: Phase start/completion
        action: reporter.startPhase()/completePhase() - always shown
      - condition: Debugging information
        action: reporter.logVerbose() - verbose only
      - condition: Errors and warnings
        action: reporter.logError()/logWarning() - always shown
        
  mcp_toolset_selection:
    question: Which toolset tier should I use for this workflow?
    branches:
      - condition: Minimal token overhead, basic code intelligence
        action: Use --toolset core (6 tools)
      - condition: Standard workflows with occasional data sync
        action: Use --toolset default (8 tools) or omit flag
      - condition: Need cross-session memory
        action: Use --toolset memory (14 tools)
      - condition: Advanced workflows requiring expertise validation
        action: Use --toolset full (19 tools)

  context_storage_database:
    question: Which database should I use for workflow context storage?
    branches:
      - condition: Context for inter-phase workflow handoffs
        action: Use main KotaDB database (.kotadb/kota.db)
        rationale: Enables future MCP tool access
      - condition: Automation execution metrics
        action: Use automation metrics DB (automation/.data/metrics.db)
        rationale: Automation-specific operational data
      - condition: Code intelligence data
        action: Use main KotaDB database (.kotadb/kota.db)

  context_curation_timing:
    question: When should context curation run?
    branches:
      - condition: After analysis phase
        action: Curate context for plan phase
      - condition: After plan phase
        action: Curate context for build phase
      - condition: After build phase
        action: Curate context for improve phase
      - condition: After improve phase
        action: Auto-record outcome (no curation)
      - condition: Curator fails
        action: Log warning, continue workflow

  worktree_database_path:
    question: Which database path should MCP use in worktree context?
    branches:
      - condition: Running in worktree for isolated workflow
        action: Use mainProjectRoot for KOTADB_PATH (main repo DB)
        rationale: Worktrees share database with main repo
      - condition: Running in main repo
        action: Use projectRoot for KOTADB_PATH
        rationale: Standard single-location setup

patterns:
  console_reporter_pattern:
    structure: Class with ANSI constants, verbosity-aware methods, phase tracking
    usage: Real-time user feedback with transparent action logging
      
  sdk_hook_pattern:
    structure: HookCallback functions with event_name discrimination
    usage: Intercept tool execution and SDK notifications
      
  haiku_curator_pattern:
    structure: Separate SDK query() call with haiku model between phases
    usage: Query memory tools, synthesize curated summary, store context
    
  auto_recording_pattern:
    structure: Post-workflow haiku call to record outcome
    usage: Success -> decision, Failure -> failure, learning flywheel

  workflow_id_generation_pattern:
    structure: adw-<issueNumber>-<timestamp> format with filesystem-safe timestamp
    usage: Unique identifier for workflow runs enabling context accumulation

  context_upsert_pattern:
    structure: INSERT ON CONFLICT UPDATE with upsert semantics
    usage: Idempotent context storage allowing phase re-execution

  git_status_regex_pattern:
    structure: /^..\s+(.+)$/ to extract filename from porcelain format
    usage: Robust parsing of git status output for any status code combination
    rationale: Handles " M ", "??", "MM", "A ", "D ", renamed files, etc.

  mcp_stdio_configuration_pattern:
    structure: args array with explicit --stdio flag after kotadb command
    usage: MCP server configuration for SDK integration
    example: |
      ["--bun", "kotadb", "--stdio"] or
      ["--bun", "kotadb", "--stdio", "--toolset", "memory"]
    rationale: Explicit stdio mode declaration for SDK MCP protocol

  database_path_threading_pattern:
    structure: Pass mainProjectRoot separately from projectRoot through all layers
    usage: Enable MCP to use main DB even when executing in worktree
    rationale: Worktrees don't have their own .kotadb directory

  pr_validation_evidence_pattern:
    structure: Run validation commands, capture results, include in PR body
    usage: Transparent quality gates in automated PRs
    rationale: Matches /git:pull_request template standards
