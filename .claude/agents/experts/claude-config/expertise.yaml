overview:
  description: |
    Claude Code configuration for KotaDB—.claude/ directory structure, command patterns,
    hook implementation with standard Python (hook_helpers.py), agent registry management,
    and expert domain organization. This expertise enables correct configuration of Claude
    Code within the KotaDB codebase conventions.
  scope: |
    Covers .claude/ directory organization (agents/, commands/, hooks/, hooks/utils/),
    command frontmatter with Template Category, hook implementation using standard Python
    with hook_helpers.py utilities, agent-registry.json maintenance, expert 4-agent pattern
    (plan/build/improve/question in agents/experts/<domain>/), and KotaDB-specific conventions.

    KOTADB ADAPTATIONS:
    - Hooks use standard Python with hook_helpers.py (NOT uv shebang)
    - Commands include Template Category field
    - Tools in agent frontmatter use YAML array format (NOT comma-separated)
    - Agent-registry.json must be updated when adding agents
    - Logging uses sys.stdout.write (never print())
    - Local-only SQLite storage (no cloud dependencies)

    Does NOT cover agent prompt content authoring (see agent-authoring expert).
  rationale: |
    Correct .claude/ configuration enables tooling, discoverability, and maintainability.
    Poor structure creates fragmentation and breaks tooling. KotaDB has established
    conventions that differ from other Claude Code projects and must be followed.

key_operations:
  create_slash_command:
    when: Adding new command functionality
    approach: |
      1. Create .claude/commands/<category>/<name>.md
      2. Add frontmatter and Template Category:
         ```markdown
         # /command-name

         **Template Category**: Path Resolution | Action | Reference

         Brief description of command purpose.

         ## Inputs
         - `$1` (param_name): Description

         ## Context

         **Project**: KotaDB - HTTP API service for code indexing
         ...

         ## Instructions
         ...
         ```
      3. Invoked as /category:name
    examples:
      - .claude/commands/workflows/plan.md -> /workflows:plan
      - .claude/commands/docs/architecture.md -> /docs:architecture
    pitfalls:
      - what: "CRITICAL - Using colons in frontmatter string values"
        instead: "No colons in description or any YAML value"
        reason: "Colons break YAML parsing in Claude Code's configuration system"
      - what: "Missing Template Category"
        instead: "Always include Template Category after the title"
        reason: "KotaDB convention for command classification"

  implement_hook:
    when: Need to run code on agent lifecycle events
    events: [PreToolUse, PostToolUse, UserPromptSubmit, Stop]
    approach: |
      1. Create .claude/hooks/<hook-name>.py with standard Python shebang:
         ```python
         #!/usr/bin/env python3
         """Hook description."""

         import os
         import sys

         # Add parent directory for imports
         sys.path.insert(0, os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))))

         from hooks.utils.hook_helpers import (
             read_hook_input,
             output_result,
             get_file_path_from_input,
             get_project_root,
         )

         def main() -> None:
             hook_input = read_hook_input()
             # Hook logic here
             output_result("continue", "Optional message")

         if __name__ == "__main__":
             main()
         ```
      2. Exit via output_result("continue") or output_result("block")
      3. Configure in .claude/settings.json hooks object
      4. Use matcher for tool-specific targeting
    kotadb_conventions:
      - NEVER use print() - use sys.stdout.write() per logging standards
      - Import from hooks.utils.hook_helpers for shared utilities
      - Use standard Python shebang (#!/usr/bin/env python3), NOT uv
    examples:
      - auto_linter.py: PostToolUse hook for JS/TS file linting

  create_expert_domain:
    when: Adding new expert domain with queryable expertise
    approach: |
      1. Create .claude/agents/experts/<domain>/
      2. Create expertise.yaml (overview, core_implementation, key_operations,
         decision_trees, patterns, best_practices, known_issues)
         Target: 400-600 lines, max 1000 lines
      3. Create <domain>-plan-agent.md:
         - model: sonnet
         - color: yellow
         - tools: [Read, Glob, Grep, Write, Bash]
      4. Create <domain>-build-agent.md:
         - model: sonnet
         - color: green
         - tools: [Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, Bash]
      5. Create <domain>-improve-agent.md:
         - model: sonnet
         - color: purple
         - tools: [Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, Bash, Task]
      6. Create <domain>-question-agent.md:
         - model: haiku
         - color: cyan
         - tools: [Read, Glob, Grep]
      7. Update agent-registry.json with all new agents
      8. Update CLAUDE.md Expert Domains section
      9. Update /do command with domain detection patterns
    kotadb_adaptations:
      - Use YAML array format for tools (NOT comma-separated)
      - Add MCP tools where appropriate (mcp__kotadb__*)
      - Update agent-registry.json capabilityIndex, modelIndex, toolMatrix
    pitfalls:
      - what: "CRITICAL - Using colons in agent description field"
        instead: "Remove colons from description values"
        reason: "Colons cause agent discovery to fail silently"
      - what: "Forgetting to update agent-registry.json"
        instead: "Always add new agents to registry with capabilities and tools"
        reason: "Registry enables programmatic agent discovery"
      - what: "Missing CLAUDE.md updates"
        instead: "Update expert domain table and usage examples"
        reason: "Users discover experts via CLAUDE.md"
        timestamp: 2026-01-28
        evidence: commit 902c49a CLAUDE.md updates

  update_agent_registry:
    when: Adding, modifying, or removing agents
    approach: |
      1. Read current .claude/agents/agent-registry.json
      2. Update agents object with new agent definition:
         ```json
         "agent-name": {
           "name": "agent-name",
           "description": "Brief description",
           "file": "path/to/agent.md",
           "model": "haiku|sonnet|opus",
           "capabilities": [
             "capability1",
             "capability2"
           ],
           "tools": [
             "Tool1",
             "Tool2"
           ],
           "readOnly": true|false
         }
         ```
      3. Update capabilityIndex - add agent to relevant capability arrays
      4. Update modelIndex - add agent to model tier array
      5. Update toolMatrix - add agent to each tool's array
    validation:
      - Ensure file path matches actual agent location
      - Verify all tools listed exist
      - Confirm capabilities align with agent purpose
    formatting_convention:
      timestamp: 2026-01-28
      evidence: commit 902c49a agent-registry.json formatting
      pattern: |
        Use multi-line array format for readability:
        ```json
        "capabilities": [
          "capability1",
          "capability2"
        ],
        "tools": [
          "Tool1",
          "Tool2"
        ]
        ```
        NOT inline: "capabilities": ["capability1", "capability2"]
      rationale: Improves git diff readability and reduces merge conflicts when adding items

  configure_settings:
    when: Configuring permissions, hooks, or project behavior
    structure: |
      .claude/settings.json:
      {
        "statusLine": {"type": "command", "command": "..."},
        "permissions": {"allow": ["Read", "Glob"], "deny": []},
        "env": {"VAR": "value"},
        "hooks": {
          "<EventType>": [
            {
              "matcher": {"tool_name": "Edit"},
              "hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "python3 .claude/hooks/<name>.py", "timeout": 5000}]
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    notes: |
      - Local overrides in settings.local.json (gitignored)
      - Matcher enables tool-specific hooks (e.g., PostToolUse only for Edit)
      - Valid JSON (no trailing commas)
      - Hook commands use python3, not uv

  update_do_command_for_expert:
    when: Adding new expert domain to /do orchestration
    timestamp: 2026-01-28
    evidence: commit 902c49a do.md updates for 5 new domains
    approach: |
      1. Add domain to Domain Detection section with:
         - Keywords: domain-specific terms (e.g., "schema", "migration" for database)
         - Locations: relevant file paths (e.g., app/src/db/)
         - Indicators: what triggers this domain
         - Examples: sample user requests
      2. Update Pattern Classification with domain in Pattern A and B lists
      3. Add domain to orchestration pattern "Domains Using This Pattern" lists
      4. Update report templates to include new domain option
      5. Add Classification Cheat Sheet entries with verb-object patterns
      6. Add disambiguation options to include new domain
      7. Add example usage in Examples section
      8. Update Spec File Storage with new domain directory
      9. Update Implementation Notes current state count
    rationale: |
      /do command uses keyword-based classification to route to correct expert.
      Each domain needs detection patterns, examples, and orchestration updates.
  tool_permissions_philosophy:
    timestamp: 2026-01-28
    evidence: commit 446e999 tool permissions fix for 20 expert agents
    principle: "Permissive tools + strict prompts"
    when: Deciding which tools to grant expert agents
    approach: |
      Grant tools liberally based on what an agent MIGHT need, then use prompts
      to constrain behavior. This prevents workflow breakage when agents need
      capabilities for validation or verification that weren't anticipated.

      Plan agents (yellow, sonnet):
      - GRANT: [Read, Glob, Grep, Write, Bash]
      - Bash enables: git operations, file statistics, wc, verification commands
      - Rationale: Plan agents write specs and may need to check git state,
        count files, or verify current state

      Build agents (green, sonnet):
      - GRANT: [Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, Bash]
      - Bash enables: type-checking (bunx tsc), test runs (bun test), linting
      - Rationale: Build agents implement and should verify their work

      Improve agents (purple, sonnet):
      - GRANT: [Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, Bash, Task]
      - Task enables: spawning sub-agents for complex analysis
      - Rationale: Improve agents analyze patterns and may delegate to experts

      Question agents (cyan, haiku):
      - GRANT: [Read, Glob, Grep]
      - Rationale: Read-only, fast answers
    discovered_issue:
      symptom: Plan agents couldn't write specs, build agents couldn't run tests
      root_cause: Tool permissions too restrictive, agents failed tasks silently
      resolution: Added Bash to plan/build agents, Task to improve agents
      lesson: Better to grant tools and constrain via prompt than block capabilities
    examples:
      - Plan agent uses Bash for "git status" to check current branch
      - Build agent uses Bash for "bunx tsc --noEmit" to verify types
      - Improve agent uses Task to spawn scout-agent for pattern analysis

    options:
      - if: Fast, read-only exploration

      - if: Balanced implementation work
        then: sonnet (build agents, plan agents, improve agents)
      - if: Complex coordination and reasoning
        then: opus (orchestrator-agent)

  expert_location:
    question: Where to put expert files?
    options:

      - Tools as YAML array, NOT comma-separated string
      - model and color optional but recommended for expert agents
      - Description MUST NOT contain colons
      - MCP tools use mcp__server__tool format

  command_template_category:
    categories:
      path_resolution: Commands that find or locate files/resources

      reference: Commands that provide documentation
      analysis: Commands that analyze without changing
    usage: |

      **Template Category**: Action

      Command description...

  hook_helpers_pattern:
    usage: |
      from hooks.utils.hook_helpers import (
          read_hook_input,      # Parse JSON from stdin
          output_result,        # Write JSON result to stdout

          is_js_ts_file,        # Check if file is JS/TS
      )
    conventions:
      - NEVER use print() - violates logging standards
      - Always use sys.stdout.write() for output
      - Import hook_helpers from hooks.utils
      - Add sys.path.insert for parent directory access

  expert_domain_expansion:
    timestamp: 2026-01-28
    evidence: commits 902c49a (docs updates), agent-registry.json changes
    pattern: |
      When scaling from 2 to 7 expert domains, updates required:
      1. Create 4 agent files per domain (.claude/agents/experts/<domain>/)
      2. Create expertise.yaml per domain
      3. Update agent-registry.json (24+ new entries, indexes)
      4. Update CLAUDE.md expert domains table and examples
      5. Update /do command domain detection (9 sections)
      6. Maintain consistency across all domains
    challenges:
      - Registry file grows large (agent-registry.json now 873 lines)
      - /do command complexity increases with domain count
      - Multi-line JSON formatting essential for diff readability
      - Tool permissions must be consistent across similar agent roles
    best_practices:
      - Use consistent capability naming pattern (<domain>-planning, <domain>-implementation)
      - Keep domain keywords non-overlapping for routing accuracy
      - Document all domains in single CLAUDE.md table for discoverability
      - Apply uniform tool permissions across agent types (plan/build/improve/question)

best_practices:
  organization:
    - Agents in .claude/agents/, commands in .claude/commands/
    - Expert domains: agents/experts/<domain>/ (4-agent + expertise.yaml)
    - General agents at root level: build-agent.md, scout-agent.md, review-agent.md
    - Expertise.yaml: 400-600 lines target, 1000 hard limit

  commands:
    - Include Template Category after title
    - Naming: /category:command pattern
    - Use allowed-tools to restrict capabilities per command
    - CRITICAL: Never use colons in frontmatter string values

  agents:
    - Tools as YAML array format (NOT comma-separated)
    - Include constraints section for behavioral boundaries
    - Include model and color fields for expert agents
    - Update agent-registry.json for every new agent
    - CRITICAL: Never use colons in description field
    - Add MCP tools where appropriate (mcp__kotadb__*)
    - Apply "permissive tools + strict prompts" philosophy

  hooks:
    - Standard Python shebang (#!/usr/bin/env python3)
    - Import from hooks.utils.hook_helpers
    - NEVER use print() - use sys.stdout.write()
    - Use output_result() for structured responses
    - Configure in settings.json with matchers

  settings:
    - settings.json: project-wide (committed)
    - settings.local.json: local overrides (gitignored)
    - Valid JSON (no trailing commas)
    - Hook commands use python3

  expert_expansion:
    timestamp: 2026-01-28
    - Document all expert domains in CLAUDE.md for discoverability
    - Use multi-line JSON arrays in agent-registry.json for git diffs
    - Keep /do domain detection patterns specific and non-overlapping
    - Update all 3 files (CLAUDE.md, do.md, agent-registry.json) atomically
    - Grant consistent tool permissions across agent types within domain

known_issues:
  - issue: Colons in frontmatter description values break YAML parsing
    impact: Agents/commands with colons in description fail discovery silently
    resolution: Remove all colons from description field values
    prevention: Review all descriptions before commit
    status: ongoing vigilance required

  - issue: Comma-separated tools format not supported
    impact: Tools listed as "Read, Glob, Grep" won't parse correctly
    resolution: Use YAML array format for tools
    status: use correct format

  - issue: Agent registry out of sync with agent files
    impact: Programmatic discovery fails to find new agents
    resolution: Update agent-registry.json when adding/modifying agents
    status: manual maintenance required

  - issue: Hook using print() violates logging standards
    impact: Inconsistent output, potential buffering issues
    resolution: Use sys.stdout.write() per KotaDB conventions
    status: enforced via code review
  - issue: Tool permissions too restrictive for agent workflows
    impact: Agents silently fail to complete tasks (can't write specs, run tests)
    resolution: Apply "permissive tools + strict prompts" philosophy
    discovered: 2026-01-28 (commit 446e999)
    status: resolved via systematic tool permission audit

  - issue: Documentation accuracy drift over time
    impact: Broken command references, non-existent file dependencies, user confusion
    symptoms: CLAUDE.md commands that don't exist, settings.json referencing missing files
    resolution: Systematic validation of all documentation references against actual files
    discovered: 2026-02-02 (issue #77, claude-config-documentation-fixes-spec.md)
    examples:
      - /tools:bun_install, /tools:pr-review, /tools:question (non-existent commands)
      - statusline.py referenced in settings.json (non-existent file)
      - workflows/, homeserver/, app/ directories (non-existent in commands/)
      - Expert domain count mismatches (documented 7 vs actual 9)
    status: active remediation via systematic documentation cleanup
    prevention: Add documentation accuracy validation to development workflow

potential_enhancements:
  - Automated agent registry validation (compare files to registry)
  - Frontmatter linting for description colons
  - Template Category validation
  - Hook output validation
  - Expert domain registry validation (ensure CLAUDE.md, do.md, agent-registry.json in sync)
  - Tool permission consistency checker across agent types
  - Documentation accuracy validation (check all referenced commands/files exist)
  - Spec file location consistency enforcement (docs/specs/ vs .claude/.cache/specs/)

    notes: |
      Expert domain expansion cycle (7 -> 9 domains) and documentation accuracy patterns:
      - Added documentation accuracy issues pattern from claude-config-documentation-fixes-spec.md
      - Updated expert domain count from 7 to 9 domains (automation + documentation)
      - Identified systematic documentation accuracy issues (non-existent command references)
      - Added spec file location pattern observations (docs/specs/ vs .claude/.cache/specs/)
      - Updated registry expansion numbers and active domain lists
      - Added documentation accuracy validation to potential enhancements
      - Captured patterns from settings.json cleanup (statusline.py removal)
