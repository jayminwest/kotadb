# Prompt Outlines

These outlines describe the intent and required sections for each automation prompt. They act as guardrails when evolving the `.claude/commands/` library or when debugging agent behaviour.

Each outline mirrors a slash command and captures:
- Context the agent receives
- Expected response format
- Critical reminders (validation commands, git hygiene, etc.)

See individual files in this directory for details.
