# Review Playbooks

Populate this folder with markdown checklists that automation can apply during pull-request review (e.g., API change review, data migration review, security review). Each playbook should contain:
- Context / trigger conditions
- Questions or verifications to perform
- Validation commands or dashboards to inspect
- Fallback actions if criteria are not met
