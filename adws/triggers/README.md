# Trigger Configurations

Use this directory for configs that start ADW workflows (cron schedules, webhook payload examples, manual trigger templates). Suggested layout:
- `cron/` – YAML or JSON describing polling cadence and filters.
- `webhook/` – Sample payloads and signature verification notes.
- `manual/` – Templated issue comments for human-triggered runs.
